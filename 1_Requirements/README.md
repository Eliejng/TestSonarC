# **Introduction:**

The heating system is basically used to control the temperature. The user gets access to turn on the heater. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328. The functionality of the heat control system is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE.

 # **Functionality:**

- When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater.
- Next the analog input from the temperature sensor is received and digitized.
- The digitized temperature input is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation.
- The corresponding temperature values based on the digitized temperature input is transmitted by the UART protocol. Here the data is displayed on the serial monitor.

**What:**

Heated seats can make cars much more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the car's seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat warms up before the rest of the vehicle does.

**When:**

**Where:**

**Why:**

Heated seats can bring a lot of different benefits beyond just having a nice and warm place to sit. The single greatest benefit that heated seats can bring is the therapeutic warmth it offers. This is great for older drivers or people with a few aches and pains.

**How:**

The longer the seat cushion stays on, the hotter it gets. If it were to stay on for too long, it would get hot enough to become uncomfortable or even dangerous to sit in. It could even start a fire in the cushion. To prevent this, most car seat heaters have a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature in the cushion. When it reaches a certain temperature, the thermostat sends a signal, automatically turning off the relay until the seat cools down a bit. At that point, the thermostat turns the relay back on again. Many seat cushions also have “high” and “low” settings that let the driver control the temperature of the seat cushions.
